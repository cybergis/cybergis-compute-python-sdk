Release Notes
=============


What's New
----------

As of July 2022, the CyberGIS-Compute SDK has added a variety of Quality-of-Life (QOL) updates to our UI.

* **Accessing Old Jobs:** We have recieved feedback that often kernels will die or pages will be refreshed while a long-lasting job is running through compute. Recovering those jobs was a tricky manual process. Now, we have added a "Your Jobs" tab to the User Interface (UI) so that users can view and restore jobs they have run previously. "Restoring" a job in this context means it will populate the UI with that job's information, allowing you to view the job's progress, look at logs and download the results.
