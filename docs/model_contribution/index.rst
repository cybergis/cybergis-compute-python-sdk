Contributing Models
===================

.. attention::
   These guides are still a work in progress. Please let us know if you spot any issues or errors!

CyberGIS-Compute is built on *models*. Models in this context are simply code that performs some action. Models can do the same thing every time (i.e. our Hello World model which just prints "Hello World"), but CyberGIS-Compute gives model developers and users the ability to customize and experiment with models through uploading data and passing parameters. This allows model developers to build more flexible and reusable models and makes models much more interesting and valuable to those using the models.
