# Contributing

We welcome contributions, but before you send a pull request, please check that your code meets our standards. Specifically:

## Code Quaity

We recommend using flake8 and you can check the Github workflow (`.github/workflows/PythonQualityCheck.yml`) to see any errors/warning you can safely ignore. Some resources for linting:

* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
* [Linting Python in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)

## Code Tests

> :warning: **We are still working on testing, you can safely ignore Code Tests passing for now.**


## Tools for Testing Github Actions Locally

We prefer that contributions pass our Github actions, so here are some tips on checking they pass locally.

#### [act](https://github.com/nektos/act)

There are a variety of ways to install act, and once installed it offers a flexible tool for testing that your code passes Github actions. All commands should be run from the root of the repository. 

* List Github actions:

```
> act -l

Stage  Job ID       Job name             Workflow name        Workflow file            Events
0      build        build                Python Code Test     PythonCodeTestCases.yml  push  
0      flake8-lint  Python Code Quality  Python Code Quality  PythonQualityCheck.yml   push 
```

* Run a specific action locally:

```
> act -j <Jpb string>
```

* Run all actions:

```
act
```
