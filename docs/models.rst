Hello World
-----------

Our simple "Hello World" model is available on Github: `cybergis/cybergis-compute-hello-world <https://github.com/cybergis/cybergis-compute-hello-world>`_

`You can view the UI for the Hello World notebook here. <notebooks/hello_world.html>`_

This model uses the `Pysal access Python package <https://github.com/pysal/access>`_ to calculate accessibility to doctors using a variety of different metrics in Chicago, IL. Those interested should `check out the paper on the package by Saxon et. al. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-021-00126-8>`_
