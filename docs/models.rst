COVID-19 Spatial Accessibility
------------------------------

The COVID-19 Spatial Accessibility model (covid-access) uses CyberGIS-Compute to calculate spatial accessibility to hospital ventilators for the entire state of Illinois. It does this using the OpenStreetMap road network for Illinois, a dataset of hospitals, and population data. The model calculates travel-time catchments around each hospital on the OpenStreetMap road network and uses those catchments to calculate spatial accessibility. The work uses code from the following paper:

This model (pysal-access) uses the `Pysal access Python package <https://github.com/pysal/access>`_ to calculate accessibility to doctors using a variety of different metrics in Chicago, IL. Those interested should `check out the paper on the package by Saxon et. al. <https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-021-00126-8>`_

Remote Sensing Image Fusion Model

Remote sensing data fusion (data_fusion) has been extensively studied to generate high spatial- and temporal- resolution data products by integrating high-spatial-low-temporal resolution (such as Landsat) and high-temporal-low-spatial-resolution images (such as MODIS). In this model, we utilize a robust hybrid deep learning model based on a super-resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for spatiotemporal data fusion to integrate Landsat images with MODIS. The work uses code from the following paper:
